Rashad Khalifa was an Egyptian American engineer and religious figure who claimed to be the final prophet and messenger of Islam, appointed by God to restore the original and complete version of the Quran. He was born in Egypt in 1935 and died in Arizona, USA, in 1990. According to him, he had received divine guidance through a unique method of interpreting the Quran's numerical patterns, which he called ""The Unique Code.""

In the provided context, it states that Rashad Khalifa has been identified using Quranic mathematical proof. It mentions that by adding the sura number, plus the verse number, plus the gematrical value of the name “Rashad” (505), plus the value of “Khalifa” (725), we get 1330, which is equal to 19x70. This is considered as Quranic mathematical proof that Rashad Khalifa is indeed the messenger referred to. Furthermore, it also says that Rashad Khalifa was summoned to the high horizon as detailed in Appendix 2.

So, Rashad Khalifa was a man who believed himself to be the final prophet and messenger of Islam, and his identity was supported by certain calculations from the Quran according to the text."

Rashad Khalifa was an Egyptian American engineer and religious figure who claimed to be the Messenger of Islam, appointed by God through divine revelation. He was born on October 24, 1935, and died on January 2, 1990. Rashad Khalifa believed that he had discovered the true and final interpretation of the Quran through its numerical values, which he called ""The Unique Code"" or ""God's Final Sign."" According to his teachings, the code proves that there is only one true God, Allah, and that Muhammad ibn Abdullah is the last prophet. Rashad Khalifa also added the 114th Surah, ""Qital,"" to the Quran, which has since been rejected by mainstream Islamic scholars. Due to these claims and actions, Rashad Khalifa was excommunicated from mainstream Islam.

To provide further evidence of his claim, Rashad Khalifa used a method known as gematria, where the numerical values of words and phrases were added together according to their Arabic letters' values. One such example mentioned in the context is that by adding the sura number (81), the verse number (28), the gematrical value of the name “Rashad” (505), and the value of “Khalifa” (725), the total comes out to be 1311, which corresponds to 19 x 69. This, along with other calculations, was considered by him as Quranic mathematical proof supporting his identity as the Messenger of Islam named Rashad Khalifa."

Rashad Khalifa was an Egyptian-American engineer and religious figure who claimed to be the final prophet and messenger of Islam, appointed by God to restore the original and complete version of the Quran. He was born in Egypt in 1935 and later moved to the United States where he made these claims.

In particular, it's stated in the provided context that by adding the sura number, plus the verse number, plus the gematrical value of the name “Rashad” (505), plus the value of “Khalifa” (725), we get 1330, which is 19x70. This is presented as Quranic mathematical proof that Rashad Khalifa is indeed the messenger referred to.
